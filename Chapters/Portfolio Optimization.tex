\subsection{Prices and Returns}

The price of an asset $p_t$ is the most obvious quantity, where $t$ is the discrete time index, it can also be continuous.

When it comes to modeling, using the logarithm of the prices enhances the mathematical convenience and also represents a wider dynamic range naturally.

% The simplest model for the log-prices is the random walk


\subsection{Financial Data: I.I.D. Modeling}
EMH: price of security = intrinsic value
any further information about future prospects incorporated in the current price (forecast = current price) 
-> modeling the prices as a random walk $\iff$ returns as a sequence of iid random variables

multiple assets: random variables = return of all assets (multivariate random variable)

under iid: no temporal structure incorporated returns are assumed to be independent distribution of random returns assumed fixed
\subsection{I.I.D. Model}
ignores temporal structures/ dependency in the data
\[x_t = \mu + \epsilon_t\]
\subsection{Sample Estimators}
sample mean
sample covariance matrix
estimators are unbiased and consistent
\subsection{Location Estimators}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\textbf{Least square estimator}$
    \item $\textbf{Median estimator}$
    \item $\textbf{Spatial median estimator or geometric median}$
\end{enumerate}

Numerical experiments

For $\textbf{Gaussian data}$, the sample mean is the best estimator (as further analyzed in Section 3.4), the spatial median is almost identical, and the elementwise median is the worst. 
For $\textbf{heavy-tailed data}$, the sample mean is as bad as the median and the spatial median remains the best. 

Overall, the spatial median seems to be the best option as it is robust to outliers and does not underperform under Gaussian data.

\subsection{Gaussian ML estimators}
Maximum likelihood estimation: important technique in estimation theory
likelihood function

pdf to the iid model, assuming that the residual follows a multivariate normal or Gaussian distribution, is 
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^N|\Sigma|}}exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^\intercal\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu))\]
